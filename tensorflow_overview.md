# Tensorflow.js

## Scavenger Hunt
http://g.co/emojiscavengerhunt

### Training in python 
Saved as "SavedModel" also "KerasStack", different structures for similar purposes 
UI - Tensorflow.js - loads models 
Weights are pre-set, loaded in chunks for easy cacheing 
Keras is pure JSON 

### Models are converted 

* Graph optimization 
* Chunking of weights

## Performance 

* JS in Browser vs Python 
* times were slightly faster in JS

## Server Side 

* Full Node.js stack support
* V8 is fast

## Example implementation in Express 

* import tensorflow

## What's next?

* visualization
* data 
* React / Electron / Headless -> using WebGL
