# What Crafting Taught Me About Code

## Background 

* Bead weaving 
* Native american origins
* Also Inuit, Zulu, and other worldwide origins 
* is it ok to practice this craft? 
  * yes, as long as we're not recreating tribal symbolism specific and outside of the original format 

## Applied 

### Time Constraints

* From scratch or premade
* How do I speed up (optimize)
* How do I deliver more

### Material Constraints

* What can I afford right now
* What is the material a good fit for 
* Has it been tested and proven 
* Looking at something that has been used, examine how it fits within the constraints 

### Tool Constraints 

* Use the right tool for the job
  * if you need a tool, get it
* High quality tools are worth investing in 
  * it's worth paying for something that makes you more effective
* Know your tools to the appropriate level 
  * Know the boundaries, it's not needed to be completely fluent 

### People power constraints 

* What is the expertise I have available to me at this point?
* Do I need to involve more people into this process?
* How many people do I have available for this? 

## Learning on the fly 

* Identify and reinforce points of weakness 
  * areas that can break frequently will
* Find wisdom in unexpected places 
  * Design patterns - Component-based Beading, building a system of bead components to create a unified language for basing construction of beats 

## Design Patterns 

* Don't reinvent the wheel
* Favor composition over inheritance


### Components must be 

* Versatile
* Easy to modify 
* Small and digestible

## Main point 

* Hire from diverse backgrounds!
