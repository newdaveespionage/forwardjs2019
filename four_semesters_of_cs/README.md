#Four Semesters of CS in Six Hours 

##Brian Holt 

* took some CS, dropped out
* currently working with Microsoft 
* recommended learning Scheme - Book "The Little Schemer"

##Course

* Not expected to finish everything in one sitting
* Functional programming based 

##Big O

* Find the biggest contributer (in this case biggest exponent)
* Look for the largest exponent 

##Big O Applied

###Linear and Exponential

* with code containing a loop, the iterations are most likely the biggest component of adding code execution weight 
* if there's a linear iteration, it's O(n), exponential O(n to the power of 2)
* the worst-case scenario needs to be considered when examining the Big O 
* tuples (not a type in JS, but a type in Python)
  * Array of pairs of numbers
* each loop wrapping (loop within a loop) results in additional exponents 

###Recursion and Logarithmic

* in recursion Big O ends up with log n
* logarithmic due to the methodology of recursion, each recursive call has (potentially) different parameters
* With recursion, figure out the "Base Case" (when do I stop executing?) first, else stack overflows happen

###Recursion Exercise
